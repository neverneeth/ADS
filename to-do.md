# Empirical Analysis

- [x] Construct the Rotation Graph using the networkx package
    - [x] each vertex represents a binary tree with n nodes
    - [x] two trees are connected by an edge if one can be turned into the other by a single
rotation
- [ ] Visualize the graph using matplotlib
    - [ ] Presently nodes are labelled as post order traversals; find alternative. 
- [x] Compute rotation distance using BFS on the graph
- [x] Represent the rotation distance as a matrix
