# Empirical Analysis

-[] Construct the Rotation Graph using the networkx package
    -[] each vertex represents a binary tree with n nodes
    -[] two trees are connected by an edge if one can be turned into the other by a single
rotation
-[] Visualize the graph using matplotlib
-[] Compute rotation distance using BFS on the graph
-[] Represent the rotation distance as a matrix
